# The Strongest Frog Catcher! (CATCHER.GBA)

You play as Cirno, a very strong ice fairy. The goal is to catch all the frogs in each level by getting them across the line on the left of the screen.

However, the frogs won't just let you catch them. In fact, yellow frogs will shoot, and red frogs can explode! You must use your abilities to freeze frogs and avoid their attacks.
